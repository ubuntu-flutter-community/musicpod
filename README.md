## Code contributions

If you find any error please feel free to report it as an issue and describe it as good as you can.
If you want to contribute code, please create an issue first.

## Build

- for Linux desktop builds: `sudo apt install libmpv-dev mpv`
- [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (for some dependencies)
- [install flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- required for android builds: [install android-studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- required for macos builds: [install xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- as a good IDE for all builds: [install vcode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Testing

Test mocks are generated with [Mockito](https://github.com/dart-lang/mockito). You need to run the `build_runner` command in order to re-generate mocks, in case you changed the signatures of service methods.

`dart run build_runner build`

## Boring developer things

### Under the flutter hood

MusicPod is basically a fancy front-end for [MPV](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)! Without it it would still look nice, but it wouldn't play any media :D!

### Architecture: [model, view, viewmodel (MVVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)

MusicPod uses the MVVM architectural pattern, which fits the needs of this reactive app the most, and keeps all layers separated so we can exchange the implementation of one layer if we need to. [MVVM is also recommended by Flutter itself](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fwe/state-management#using-mvvm-for-your-applications-architecture).

The app, the player, the search and each main page have their own set of widgets, one or more view model, which depend on one or more services.

All services and ViewModels are registered lazily via [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it), which means they are not instantiated until they are located for the first time via `di<XyzService>` or `di<ViewModel>`.

View["`
  **View**
  (Widgets)
`"]:::view--watchProperty-->ViewModel["`
  **ViewModel**
  (ChangeNotifier)
`"]:::viewmodel--listen/get properties-->Model["`
  **(Domain) Model**
  (Service)
`"]:::model

ViewModel--notify-->View
Model--changedProperties.add(true)-->ViewModel

```

The ViewModels have a dependencies to services which are given via their constructor, where they are located via the service locator [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it). This makes them easy to test since you can replace the services with mocked services.

The ViewModels are [ChangeNotifiers](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ChangeNotifier-class.html). They can use the `notifyListener` method which makes listeners (concrete: UI classes) react (i.e. rebuild).

The ViewModels hold (a) [StreamSubscription(s)](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/StreamSubscription-class.html) to (the) service(s) they depend on. If properties are only non-persistent UI state, they are hold inside the ViewModel. If they are more than that, they are just getters to service properties.
So if a property of a service changes, the ViewModels will be notified via the propertiesChanged stream, and if we want the UI to take notice, inside the `listen` callback we will notify the UI (listeners).

### Dependency choices, service locator and state management

Regarding the packages to implement this architecture I've had quite a journey from [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) to [riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod).

I found my personal favorite solution with [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) plus its [watch_it](https://pub.dev/packages/watch_it) extension because this fits the need of this application and the [MVVM-architecture](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fwe/state-management#using-mvvm-for-your-applications-architecture) the most without being too invasive into the API of the flutter widget tree.

This way all layers are clearly separated, easy to re-implement and easy to follow, even if this brings a little bit of boilerplate code.

## Watching the ViewModels inside the View (Widgets)

If the Widgets want to be rebuilt once properties of ViewModels change, we use the `watchPropertyValue` method of the [watch_it](https://pub.dev/packages/watch_it) package:

```dart
final audio = watchPropertyValue((PlayerModel m) => m.audio);
```

This makes it easier, even though we could also just use flutters built in [ListenableBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListenableBuilder-class.html).

### Caching

Both local covers and remote covers are cached in `LocalCoverService` and a `OnlineArtService` after they have been loaded/fetched.

### Performance

Reading the local covers and fetching remote covers for radio data happens inside additional second [dart isolates](https://dart.dev/language/isolates). When idle MusiPod's CPU power consumption is 0%. For a 10 years old intel dual core, the CPU usage is about 2% while playing music, since only the parts are redrawn which need to be, thanks to watch_it.

### Persistence

Preferences are stored with [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences), collections are stored inside basic json files on our computer.
